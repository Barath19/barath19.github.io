C++, Git, and Docker to develop and deploy cutting‑edge solutions. Expertise lies in multi‑modal sensor fusion and multi‑sensor calibration.

## Professional Experience

### Senior Software Engineer - Bosch

- Led a team of three in developing a ROS‑based LiDAR‑Camera calibration package: This included implementing 3D checkerboard detection in
point clouds, ground plane separation, normal estimation, and point cloud densification.
- Intensity‑based automatic Lidar‑Camera calibration for internal Bosch Lidar sensor
- Developed the base code for checkerboard detection algorithm and automatic 3D correspondence
- Benchmarked PointPillar‑based 3D object detection for sparse radar point clouds against a Bayesian object detector, evaluating performance
metrics and accuracy.

## Education

### Msc. in Autonomous Systems
- Established foundations for robot perception, navigation, and manipulation by leveraging deep learning and implementing state‑of‑the‑art
algorithms on physical robots, with a focus on multi‑sensor fusion and 3D object detection.
- Thesis on studying the effects of calibration on perception tasks for autonomous driving. Benchmarking multi‑modal 3D object detection meth‑
ods, including TransFusion, BEVFusion, and MVXNet, on multiple AD datasets (KITTI, NuScenes, Waymo) using MMDetection3D for comparative
analysis of performance.
- Conducted perturbation experiments to evaluate the robustness of 3D object detection algorithms against extrinsic calibration errors, enhanc‑
ing the reliability of detection systems in real‑world scenarios.
- Developed a custom Isaac Gym environment for the HSR and Kinova arm to perform cabinet‑opening tasks, and trained a reinforcement learning
agent using PPO, achieving effective results with a training time of less than 1 hour.
- Generated synthetic datasets for 6D pose detection using BlenderProc2, enabling photorealistic rendering and improving the accuracy of deep
learning models for robotics.

### BTech. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering

- An Aggregate of 80.09%. Scored the highest marks for the final‑year project and ranked second in the department

### AVL Software and Functions GmbH - _Jan 2024_

- Performed LiDAR‑LiDAR calibration using various Iterative Closest Point (ICP) methods, including point‑to‑point, point‑to‑plane, and symmetric
ICP, and benchmarked these techniques on AVL datasets.
- Utilized Open3D for 3D point cloud processing, including chamfer distance calculation and animation visualization, to enhance data analysis
and representation.
- Implemented unit tests and integrated GitHub Actions for automated testing and continuous integration, improving code
reliability and development workflow.
